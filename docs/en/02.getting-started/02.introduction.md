## About

The StructuredData module is a content manager that uses drop-in "structured_data" of pre-built content.

## Features

- Define static areas of editable structured_data; i.e. your footer or sidebar. 
- Use the included structured_data field type to add structured_data to any streams object like pages or blog posts.  
- Extension based structured_data are installable from Control Panel, powered by addons, and 100% override-able/customizable.
