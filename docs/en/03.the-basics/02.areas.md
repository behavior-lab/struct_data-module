# Areas

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

Areas are static drop-zones for structured_data. Areas are great for managing structured_data that display in your footer, sidebar, below a post, etc. 

### Creating Areas

You can create areas through the control panel and assign structured_data to them there as well.

Creating areas programmatically is the same as creating any other stream:

```php
use ConductLab\StructDataModule\Area\Contract\AreaRepositoryInterface;

public function example(AreaRepositoryInterface $areas) {
    $this->areas->create(
        [
            'en' => [
                'name'        => 'Footer',
                'description' => 'Add structured_data here to display in your footer.',
            ],
            'slug' => 'footer',
        ]
    );
}
```
